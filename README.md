# rosalind
A collection of my (mostly) Python code for Rosalind (http://rosalind.info) over the past several years.

Most of my older code was written in Python 2, while my newer work is written in Python 3.

A couple of the solutions use C++ for performance reasons, but are based on my Python solution.
